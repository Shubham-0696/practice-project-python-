Project Simple Text-Based Calculator with Calculation History<br>
Features:<br>
<br>
Basic Calculations:<br>
<br>
Prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /).<br>
Perform the calculation.<br>
Display the result to the user.<br>
Handle potential errors like division by zero and invalid input (non-numeric input for numbers, invalid operation).<br>
Calculation History:<br>
<br>
Store each calculation (e.g., "10 + 5 = 15") in a text file named calculator_history.txt.<br>
Append each new calculation to the end of the file so that the history is preserved across multiple runs of the program.<br>
View History:<br>
<br>
Provide an option for the user to view the calculation history stored in the calculator_history.txt file.<br>
Display the history to the console, perhaps with line numbers for better readability.<br>
Exit:<br>
<br>
Allow the user to exit the calculator program.<br>
